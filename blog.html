            <h2>Difference between Local Storage and Session Storage.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire,
                whereas
                sessionStorage
                data is cleared when the page session ends.</p>

            <ul class="blog-list-text-align">
                <li>The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB.</li>
                <li>As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually.</li>
                <li>The client can only read local storage.</li>
                <li>There is no transfer of data to the server.</li>
                <li>There are fewer old browsers that support it</li>

                <li>The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB.</li>
                <li>It’s session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is <br> stored only for the
                    duration
                    of a session, i.e.,
                    until the browser (or tab) <br> is closed.</li>

            <h2>Difference between Global Scope and Block Scope.</h2>
            <br>
            <h3 class="bold green">Global Scope</h3>
            <p>Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block simply consists
                of grouped
                statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of structure that
                create a code block.
                A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code. By simply
                means, the variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and
                have global scope.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="bold green">Block Scope</h3>
            <p>A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible
                within that
                particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the curly braces are called as
                within block
                scope. Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope.</p>

            <h2>How Event Loop works in JavaScript?</h2>
            <br>

            <p>The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the
                Task Queue to
                the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available
                callbacks. If we precisely explain it then we can say that, Event loop is an endless loop, which waits
                for tasks, executes them and then sleeps until it receives more tasks. The
                event loop executes tasks from the event queue only when the call stack is empty i.e. there is no
                ongoing task. The
                event loop allows us to use callbacks and promises.</p>

            <h2>How many types of “undefined” we get in JavaScript?</h2>
            <ul class="blog-list-text-align">
                <li>The typeof operator returns undefined when the variable is declared but not defined.</li>
                <li>The type and value of an empty string and an undefined variable are two different things.
                    The undefined variable has a data type “undefined” while an empty string has a data type “string”.
                </li>
                <li>The amount of arguments we provide in JavaScript need not match the function's parameters. The
                    unpassed parameters are
                    set to undefined.</li>
                <li>When a function has no return value, it returns undefined.</li>
                <li>Trying to access a non-existing property of an object returns undefined.</li>
                <li>Non-existing array elements also return undefined.</li>
                <li>The void operator always returns undefined irrespective of the expression provided to it.</li>
